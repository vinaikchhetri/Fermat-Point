# Weiszfeld approximation algorithm for approximating the Fermat point for arbitrary dimension of points.

This is a modification and an implementation of Weiszfeld approximation algorithm from the paper: https://cs.nyu.edu/exact/doc/fermat-esa21.pdf. There are 2 version of the implementation––– one using standard cpp numerical precision and the other using "exact" precision (CORE). CORE can be installed from https://cs.nyu.edu/exact/core_pages/intro.html. 

 The dataset and the corresponding dimension can be changed in the main.cpp file.
## Run
```
make
